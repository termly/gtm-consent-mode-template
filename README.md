# Termly Consent Mode

This template enables users of Termly's Consent Management Platform (CMP) to make use of Google Tag Manager's consent configurations. 

This is accomplished by translating consent preferences set in Termly's banner into GTM's consent types, giving Tag Manager users more control over how and when tags are triggered based on user consent.

Termly's CMP must be installed separately.
